    <h1> What is This?</h1>
    <p>This is my public digital journal that I write in. It's purpose is 3 fold
      </p> 
      <ol>
        <li>Replace my social media use with something a little less instant, and a little more personal</li>
        <li>Have a space to share my thoughts and find some therapy in writting about my life</li>
        <li>Share what I am working on and find some level of strange accountability as I put my progress into the ethernet.</li>
      </ol>
    <p> I will be writing an entry every two weeks, which you can find by hitting the Most Recent post button</p>
