    <h1> What is This? Is the title true? Are you okay?</h1>
    <p>This is my public digital journal that I write in. I always have talked with myself a lot. Not in the multiple personality way, so guess its not really talking to myself, it's more of an inner monologue. I find it theraputic, or at least a way I find living better. Slow down, and talk myself through my life and thoughts. 
      I ended up spending a lot of time by myself as a kid, and I wonder if this is its consequence.
      As I get older and life is getting faster, I am both suffering from not having the supply of time while the demand for reflection increases. Additionally, my ability to waste time via distractions and distance myself from my life is easier then ever; all while my responsibilities and productivity demand me to do the opposite. So, in a way, this seems to be a solution. So I see this websites purpose as 3 fold
      </p> 
      <ol>
        <li>Have a space to share my thoughts and find some therapy in writting about my life</li>
        <li>Replace my social media use with something a little less instant, and a little more personal</li>
        <li>Share what I am working on and find some level of strange accountability as I put my progress into the ethernet.</li>
      </ol>
    <p> I will be writing an entry every two weeks, which you can find by hitting the Most Recent post button.</p>
    <h1>This is not a blog, or a digital diary</h1>
    <p>I am not sure what stigma I picked up on but I don't really want this or myself to be either of those things. Its not fair to them, but I always see 'bloggers' as either forwarding themselves/something or self centered people.
      Which is ironic beacuse the word "I" xx times and "my" xx times in this page alone. But I see my purposes as different then purley updating others on my life or displaying my accomplishments. Like I said, I talk to myself a lot, and 
      that is what this is going to be like. Which, now that I think about it, may be worse. I wouldn't consider this to be a 'diary' either, as, yes I'll be putting my thoughts and feelings on display, it's not containing 
      things that I want to be private or secret. To me, a diary very personal and private. I think 'digital journal' would be the best way to describe this. I don't know why, but I am feeling
      very particular about this topic and I ackowledge that it is silly. Maybe I'm trying to seem more macho by calling it a journal, I don't know, but thats how it is. 
    </p>
    <p>So if you ever want to tease me, just tell me I am a blogger who has a digital diary.

    <h1>Getting Caught up on the Lore</h1>
    <p>
      I’m 24 and have been married to the love of my life, Judy, for 2 years now. I drive a volkswagon beetle convertible and just finished working at Walmart. I am majoring in Computer Engineering at BYU-I in Rexburg Idaho and graduate in April. I am hoping to work in the ASIC/FPGA space as a design verification engineer; Embedded systems is my runner up (hook me up if you can). My ultimate goal is to work for myself. I am an avid gamer, and am interested in game development as well. I love cooking, electronics, music, and have played a lot of DnD. Having ADHD is a big part of my life right now as I seem to be transitioning into adulthood ADHD, making dealing with it novel in all the wrong ways. It’s been such a big swing that I have had to delay my graduation by about a year, which I am unhappy about. I’m a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and served an LDS mission in Sydney Australia and Detroit Michigan for a combined total of 2 years. I miss Australia very much (looking at you, döner kebab). Lots of good and bad there, but it was a great place!

    <h1>Whats a Scorncob Anyway?</h1>
    <p>Scorncob is my general use online name. The domain was available, so I got it! Scorncob originated first as ‘scorn’ when I was younger, named after the villain in Gauntlet: Dark Legacy, which was among the first video games i’ve played. When my father bought me my Minecraft account, scorn was taken already! So, in true dad fashion, he made a pun out of it, and thus sCornCob was born. </p>
    <h1>Post Structure</h1>
    <p>Paragraphs will be ordered from most relevant to least for the average reader. I’m thinking life updates at the top, and project work/more for me stuff at the bottom. I am going to refrain from adding pictures or anything more then text as I want to keep this very lightweight. I’m sure there will be exceptions at some point. </p>
    <h1>Contacting Me</h1>
    <p>If you would like to chat with me, shoot me an email first at everett@buttars.net, and then we can find a better way to talk! </p>
