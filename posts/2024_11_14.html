    <h1>Its not Me, it's my Calendar. I swear</h1>
    <h2>Late Once again! but I Blame my Calendar.</h2>
    <h2>Calender? I Hardly Know Her!</h2>
    <p> 
      I don’t have a calendar, but I am seriously considering getting one. I often feel like I have too many things going on and constantly forget, so the calendar and to-do list would be the perfect addition to my life. Except for the part where I cannot for the life of me, stick to one or any organization. Consistency is not my strong suit and I feel like I never succeeded in willingly building habits. I think I just need to try a bunch until one sticks. Find what’s right for me, ya know? Both find what’s right for me, and stick with it long enough that my brain remembers and does it normally. Habits are hard for ADHD people. But I could be cool and organized, and hopefully get more out of my days. I could tell people I can “check my calendar,” or “pencil them in.” I often find myself regretting making the commitments when the day comes though. Its nothing against anything, I’m just resistant to do most things, especially if I’m in a flow or specific mood. I typically have a good time once I get started. My dad pointed that out to many years ago and I always keep telling myself that. So that’s a drawback to calendars, but it would be good for me to ‘do’ things. Cool people have calendars, and I'm... cool? Anyway, calendars and daily organization: what I need in my life, what I want in foresight, what I despise in the moment, what I regret not having after.

    <h2>School is Life Right Now</h2>
    <p>I don't really have many updates for my life, as most of my time is dedicated to school (or at least should be). My folks are coming up to have thanksgiving with us this year, which I'm really excited for. Judy is an early-christmas-er, so our house is slowly being decorated. I have been missing having my friends close by, so I am also feeling extra modivated to work/be done with school. Even if I don't get a great job, at least I'll be able to see them.

    <h2>Semester: the Final Stretch</h2>
    <h4> A lot going on with school, so I put it last so you can skip it if you want</h4>
    <p>
      Been a good semester so far, much much much better then the previous. I was struggling to stay afloat about halfway through but I’m back on top (mostly) and feeling good about finishing out the semester. I have some worries about classes, but we’ll get to those in a moment. I made an appointment with the counseling center to see if I could get any help with managing my ADHD. I am coming to the conclusion that when I stopped taking my meds and failed school for a year I built a lot of anxious/not so good habits, so I think maybe some help decoupling that could be nice. Additionally, I don’t have paperwork saying that I have ADHD due to being diagnosed in middle school, so that could help a lot in the future. Especially because I am thinking about trying to get an exception/exemption for my last year of school. If you go to them and present your case, they can sometimes help by making your schooling more flexible and even expunging previous semesters. It could be big for me considering I went from 3.8 GPA to a 3.02. I know 3.02 really isn’t that bad, but it also isn’t really me.  The counseling center is way booked though, and I only managed to secure a meeting 2 weeks away! So, I’ll tell you next time. Or I guess the time after.

      As far as classes go, things are okay. I am battling getting caught up on one of my classes (So many lab reports!), my other classes are going well. I had a small hiccup where I ran out of my meds and then flubbed school for like a week. Luckly, my supporting wife helped me make sure I got them and got back on track. Love you Judy! My Microbiology class is scaring me though. Every week gets a little more complicated and I frankly forget what I learned the week before. Theres just so many specific processes, procedures, and protocols that I learn that are backed with a thick wall of vocabulary. I have a test this Friday. I am worried to say the least. I am praying the final isn’t cumulative.

      My digital design class (The class I am hoping to make a career out of) is going well though. We have a big final project due at the end of the semester and I have started building the foundation of it for this previous week’s lab. The bad news is that I ran into some design issues and major bugs, that forced me to re-write a lot of it twice now. It’s difficult, but my professor is both understanding and impressed. So, I think he’ll let me off the hook. The plan is to have a USB keyboard hooked up to an FPGA that’s hooked up to a computer (Via USB). Using the input from the keyboard, communicate with the computer via UART and have the letters display in a terminal on the computer. Basically, interpret the keyboard, send it over USB in UART protocol to the PC. It’s been going well. I believe I just finished the UART portion, which means it’s onto the keyboard. I have roughly 3-4 weeks to finish the whole project, so I’m sure I’ll be fine. It’s gonna look great on my resume too, I think!

      My circuit design class has had a huge uptick in difficulty. We were talking about sinusoidal waves and phasors. Basically, AC rather than our typical DC voltage. Remember the imaginary number i? That’s my life now. Polar form, rectangular form, whatever it may be, complex numbers are complex. Theres a lot to it, and I have a great grasp on it conceptually, but mathematically I am doing SOMETHING wrong. Both homeworks have been a nightmare. Resulting in 20% and  40% on the actual work. Luckily, I get points for just attempting them. I had to then take the test yesterday though, and that went surprisingly well I think. I feel like I got the right numbers, and they all lined up with the multiple-choice answers. All the good stuff. We’ll see when the scores come in. Luckily, this is supposedly the hardest unit, so if I survived this, I’m chillin. Next is Laplacian transformations and linear algebra to solve complex circuits. Glad I took linear algebra already!

      I am worried about failing one of my classes, but I am talking it out with my professor. I hope he's understanding of my situation. I don't think he checks his email very often, thats for sure. But hey, one class failed is better than all of them I guess :p

    <h2>Misc</h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li> I think I may try non-stimulant medication for my ADHD. Problem is it takes some time to come into effect, and I don't have time to be borderline useless</li>
        <li> Outside of school, I think exercise should be one of my biggest goals. Its embaressing being out of breath all the time</li>
        <li> I listened to the Creed discography, its a good time. I enjoyed it a lot.</li>
        <li> Job search is continuing without any luck</li>
        <li> Game dev has been alright, just getting back into it. School always come first, which means theres not a lot of time left over</li>
        <li> I was feeling really bumbed about myself for the past 3-4 weeks as lifes been getting harder. Just feel like I can't change and no habits i'm making are sticking. Life accelerates and I already haven't been able to keep up for a while. Feeling better today however.</li>
