    <h1>Another Start to School</h1>
    <h2>A Hopeful Start</h2>
    <p> Another semester has started! Hopefully my second to last. I am in 5 classes this semester, three of which I have started in the past.
      These 3 are circuit design, digital system design, and embedded systems. A good selection I'd say. Circuit design is a challenging class, but since I've been through the first bit of it,
      I'm feeling very confident. The other classes are not to difficult. Digital system design is a class about what I'm hoping to do for work;
      HDLS and FPGAs. My last 2 classes are micro-biology and PCB design. PCB design is just a really long tutorial it seems, but micro-biology... boy howdy.
    </p>  
    <h2>Micro-Biology? For a Computer Guy?</h2>
    <p>
      On the icebreaker post I made to introduce myself to the class (its online), I said I was a computer engineering major.
      This attracted a lot of attention in the form of "what are you doing here and why are you taking this class?" Which is a fair question.
      I have to take breadth science courses beacuse I'm an engineer. From the selection, I decided this was the most interesting to me and the
      class I know the least about. Which is proving to be true. For a class with no prerequesits, this class sure asks you a lot of questions about
      things you learned in the past. I don't mind, its kind of what I was expecting to jump into, but still suprising just how much
      I need to remember. The class primarily focuses on bacteria and viruses with an emphasis on diseases. Which is good because I took 
      Pathophysiology in high school. This course does seem time intensive, but not too difficult. Which for me, I think may be worse.
    </p>
    <h2>Sticking to a Schedule</h2>
    <p>Time intensive courses have historically been tough for me. That ADHD dog in me makes setting aside time for anything difficult
      This has gotten me in trouble previously. I have noticed over the past year that if I am home, it is hard to focus on things that aren't at home.
      I've got some sort of object/project permanence problem. My goal this semester is to stay on campus till my homework gets done.
      I get to school in the morning, and go home when I'm done, usually around 4-4:30. I'm treating it like a job I guess. 
      Between this and me starting Adderal again, I am having a very promising start. I am determined to succeed this semester.
    </p>
    <h1>the Internship Problem</h1>
    <p>
      One of the requirements for me to graduate is to get an internship. This is a difficult requirement as the market for them in the computer field is quite scarce.
      There is another way to graduate, but I would need to take an additional semester, which I don't want to do. But, unless my internship is part time and remote, I won't be 
      able to be on campus when it happens. Meaning that I will likely graduate in July, or even December, rather then April. Sad. But, I'd be happy to graduate in the first place.
      I am quite worried about getting a job. Luckily, because I am computer engineering, I have a few niches I can fill that the horde of comp sci people can't.
      We shall see how it turns out though. A friend of mine in class told me about a place he got an interview with that does part time, so this could be big for me!
