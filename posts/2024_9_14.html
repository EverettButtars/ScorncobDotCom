    <h1> Disney Land and the School Lead Up</h1>
    <h2>DISNEY</h2>
    <p>This past week I had the lovely oppurtunity to visit Disney land with my wife, Judy. My wife was very excited about our trip so she made a big plan, looked through
      all the food, planned which rides are worth skipping, when to ride the longer wait rides. It was great for me! Got the best of the best. We were also at Disney Land a couple months after we got married, so we just had a few rides to do and then we had tried everything.
      I am normally not a rollercoaster person, but I sucked it up for my wife and I actually really enjoyed them! I dislike that feeling of my stomach lifting up when there are sharp drops, but that didn't happen much this time.
      However, my body discovered motion sickness, and decided it was all about that. All spinning rides are now the bane of my existance. Unluckily, I found this out at the top of the ferris wheel and had to keep it together till we got to the bottom.
      We were on the swinging set of cariges, and they move A LOT. That, combined with maybe a little heat exhaustion, made for a queezy time at the top.
      I also developed blisters on both feet, one on each heel and one on each palm. One major upside of us going labor day week was that everyone was in school! After monday, wait times were super super low. It made riding our favorites super easy. 
      Other than that, great food, great rides, great time with my wife!

    <h2>Pre-School</h2>
    <p> School starts for me on the 16th. So I have had a week to chill and prepare. I mostly have been playing video games truthfully. A lot of Wizard 101, Helldivers 2, Guild Wars 2.
      Truthfully, it feels both very relaxing and kind of wasteful. I've got 1 week before school! I need to live it up; and Wizard 101 is not living it up.
      I have been working on applying to jobs, cleaning the house, and game dev stuff, but I do kind of want to get outside before school starts and the dreaded Rexburg winter sets in.

    <h2>Buy It For Life</h2>
    <p>
      Speaking of winter, I have been shopping for some winter clothing, as mine seems to wear out kind of quick. I ended up going down a rabbit hole 
      and, basically, am tired of buying cheap garbage from over seas. Of course, theres a place for temp/trendy items, but man am I tired of buying the same things over and over again. And i've only been an adult for like 7 years!
      Its something I have been doing a lot of reaserch about. Its good for the "buisness" (the shareholders), but terrible for the consumer (Everyone). People are still using 
      fridges from the 60s, can openers from the WW2, and pea coats from the 20s, but I can't get a pair of jeans to last more then a summer. Aditionally, brands that were BIFL have, of course, been bought
      and in search of that sweet, sweet temporary profit margin gain, sent their manufacturing over seas as well and are coasting off their brands reputation. Not happy, Bob. Not. Happy. A lot of the people in this area are either college students or people who have been here since the dawn of time. So I am hoping to go thrifing weekly so I can find some tried and true american made clothing. I also have been reading about stiching and 
      specifically how you can elongate the life span of pants. Its all been really interesting and am hoping to one day give it all a try and look back one day at the things I haven't had to buy again in decades.

    <h2> Misc</h2>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li> I saw Toy story for the first time this week. My wife is trying to show me all the Disney/Pixar stuff I havent seen. Strangly, I have seen the second and third, but never the first. I liked it a lot! I a see why there are 3 sequals</li>
        <li> I listned to Ariana Grande's discography this week, she is a talented singer, but her songs are mostly miss. Nothing new for a musician though</li>
        <li> I also listend to Weezer's discography this week, and it was about the same. Really great song writting occasionaly, and a lot of album padding</li>
        <li> The tech job market is not very good right now. There are so many applicants for every role I look at. I saw one
           today that was less then 4 hours old with over 100 applicants. One of the trending repositories this week on Github was an AI job applier, that will auto seek jobs, tailor your resume, and auto apply to them. I am still trying, but I am also dedicating a lot of time to hopefully work for myself. That would be the dream, but I know I'd have to put in the time now. So I am trying to.</li>
        <li> I started devloping a game this week for fun. Its a spin on the classic COD Zombies formula that I'm hoping to make my own and have fun with. It's coming together slowly so far. Once the core systems are inplace, it'll be time for testing, refinment, and A LOT of learning to 3D model</li>
        <li>BYU-I gave me a scholarship for $1200. Thats really nice! I am not sure why, but hey, I'll sure as heck take it</li>
