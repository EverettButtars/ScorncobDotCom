    <h1>School and Games: The Price</h1>
    <h2>I wrote a lot to make up for missing last week: enjoy!</h2>
    <h2>Life is School</h2>
    <p> Whenever I have to give life updates to friends, its always a little disheartening. Because I am taking much longer to graduate, my life has remained basically the same 
      for quite some time. While others are getting jobs and moving onto bigger things, I get tell them I'm still in school, no internship or job prospects, and Judy still works at Walmart.
      I have plenty of things I could talk about in my day to day life, but no updates on the progress of whats happening in my life.
      "Nothing new really, just waiting to be done with school," I usually say. A rut I seem to be in for sure. I'm taking things at my own speed,
      and life isn't a race, but I just wish I could be done with school. Hopefully I can gradutate in April, like I want. Theres a possibility 
      I'll need to stay till July, as it seems I likely won't be getting an internship. My last semester would have 1 class in it, which stinks for a number of reasons.
      Oh how can I not wait for the days when I can just go to work, get paid, and come home to my wife.
    </p>  
    <h2>The School Corner</h2>
    <p>
      School so far has been good, I'm staying a float mostly. I am behind in 1 of my classes, but only because I need to write my lab report. I hate lab reports.
      All of my classes except 1 have lab reports, meaning I write at least 4 a week. So time consuming and tedius. I understand why, but I do not enjoy it. I just need to knock it out and get it done,
      it's only an hour of my week max; but those 20 min or so at a time are brutal for me. 
    </p>
    <p>Going to class has historically been the biggest challenge for me. Its usually the first thing to go when I start falling behind. Which is why I make a point to mention it here as 
      I am having a hard time getting to class right now. I'm caught up on my work and reading, so I don't really get very much value out of going to class.
      Aside from the fact that I do most of my work during class because I don't have to pay much attention. I don't get a ton of work done at home, so going to class helps me get it done.
      But I don't feel the need to go to class because class itself isn't helpful. Its just something that needs to happen, and thats what I always tell myself. Just need to get there, and then it'll be fine.
      I found that if I take my adderall an hour or so before I wake up, it makes it a lot easier. But its still always a difficult choice for me (for no logical reason), and I have to make it every morning. 
      Consistency is by far my weakest suit. Which is unfortunate, as it seems consistency is what makes people go round.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as school content goes, classes have been following their usual difficulty progression. Notably, micro-biology is very difficult. Not because of the concepts, but because everything has its own 
      set of vocabulary that I need to memorize before the end of the week. My time is usually spent 15% learning the concept, and 85% memorizing all its particular words. In my embedded systems class, this time 
      around I proposed to make an oscilloscope, which is like a more robust Multi-Meter. My project idea was selected for my group and off we go making it. Theres been some interesting challenges, but so far so good.
      I elected to make a much simpler project this time around as I this time accepted the fact that I usually end up doing most of the technical work. Not because of my group members, but because I fear it wont get done
      and just decide to do it myself. When it comes to being at a job, getting a feel for co-workers is easy. But with 2 random classmates, the bag is about as large as it can be. Thinking about it, I have done at least since highschool, so maybe I just like being in control or something. 
      I find it much easier when I know how all the parts are coming together, so maybe I just need to make more detailed plans and I could relax a bit. I think I'll try that for this class.
    </p>
    <h2>A Hallowed What?</h2>
    <p>I dont have any plans for Halloween it seems. I'll probably just watch Over the Garden Wall again with Judy and do some homework. I always love the thought of doing social things on Halloween,
      but I just don't have it in me this year I think. I did think of a pretty great costume though! I was thinking about going as an 'Ipad kid.' Get some khaki shorts, a tacky shirt with fortnite,
      or skibi toilet on it, and then one of those bulky neon colored ipad cases with the handles that also seem to made of foam. I would go around talking at the party saying everyones favorite current 
      brain rot slang, punctuating every sentance with 'widdiwiwy,' and seeming generaly not interested in anything. Maybe next year. Judy is having fun decorating for Halloween though! Are apartment complex 
      is having a door decorating challenge and Judy has a great plan! She's gonna decorate one half of the door as 'trick' with spooky stuff on it, and the other 'treat' with candy and such on it. It seems 
      like a really fun idea! 
    </p>
    <h2>Video Games: my greatest vice and strength</h2>
    <p>
      Playing video games has been something that has been both great and not great for me. I often spend far to much time playing games then I should. Its an easy way to distract my self. During my failed semesters at college,
      I would often skip class due to being stressed/anxious(usually a combination of being behind and feeling bad about missing previous classes), I would tell myself I would stay home and catch up on homework. 
      Then, I would 'destress' by playing games to take my mind off of it; resulting in me being at home, anxious about my classes, attempting to distract myself out of desperation, and then not ever fix my problems making me more anxious. 
      Another problem is a lot of video games are terrible destressers. They're really just distractions, and I often just feel guilty playing them because I should be on the grind, so they rarely lower my stress. I know I would consider it my hobby,
      and its how I spend time with my friends and family, so it should have some place in my life. But, between my worsening ADHD and my need to finish school and ensure work in the future, its something I need to make some new habits on.
      Having a healthy relationship with games is going to be difficult for me. I also feel never touching games again is both unrealistic and also an undesirable outcome for me. Another thing to change. I hope I can make it happen this time.
    </p>
    <p>With that out of the way, I started 2 new great projects this week! I love starting projects and not finishing them! The first is a 3D Zelda inspired game with the main draw being the locations of key items are randomized. I am a big 
      fan of Zelda: Ocarine of Time randomizers, and I think that in a standalone game would be really fun. I've made good headway on the inital controls and systems (mainly the movement). But thats only the very very first step. I hope after
      the more techincal stuff is fixed, the sailing will be smoother. When it comes to building games, it's easy to run into a road block and run out of steam. My other project is a minecraft modpack I'm calling Super Flat-Block. Inspired by 
      various other modded skyblock packs, this one puts you into a superflat world with the premise of you being an engineer for a multi-dimensional company whose job it is to create products from the given resources of the dimension. The whole 
      business aspect of it is supposed to be very tacky and stereotypical in all the funny ways, with your quest giver being your manager who just graduated college with an undergrad in marketing, an MBA and 0 work experience. I was able to complete
      putting all the mods and changes I needed together, so now its just writing and makign the quests! Which should make the rest of it a lot easier. I'm excited. I think I could be done by my next post! So I'll update yall on it next time.
